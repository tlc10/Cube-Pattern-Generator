# Cube-Pattern-Generator
This program realized in python allows to generate the pattern of a cube. Each face of the cube is composed of a photo chosen by the user.

When the user chooses a photo from the image library, they select a square portion of that image to match the face of a cube. He repeats the operation 6 times to complete the 6 faces of the cube. The algorithm then generates the cube pattern with the 6 square images.
